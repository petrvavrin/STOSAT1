# STOSAT1
### !!The project is under development!!
The STOSAT1 project is a scaled down version of the CubeSat satellite, containing most of what the real cubesat does.
Solar battery charging, ESP-07 module, SDHC storage.

The schematic is drawn in EAGLE, [here](STOSAT1_EAGLE_2.1) is the complete EAGLE project.

The firmware is written in PlatformIO.

In PlatformIO I recommend to upload to ESP with the following .ini [parameters](STOSAT1_FIRMWARE/platformio.ini).
